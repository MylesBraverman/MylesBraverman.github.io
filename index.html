                <p class="aboutMe">I am a senior at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. I am a double major in Computer
                    Science and Studio Art (Photography Concentration). I am passionate about being kind to people and
                    learning new things.

            <h2 class="section-h2">My current studies:</h2>
            <p class="section-p">Right now, I am taking two computer science courses - CS321 and CS343</p>
            <p class="section-p">CS231 is all about software engineering. I am learning the actual coding
                side of building software, including html, css, javascript, flask, and git. And, equally as important, I
                am also learning about the software development process itself, including the product life cycle,
                version control, and different project management workflows. Over the course of the semester, I am
                working with a team to build a real world software solution from the ground up, giving me hands on
                experience and practice with all of these concepts. </p>
            <p class="section-p">CS343 is about neural networks. I am learning the theory, algorithms, and components of
                foundational neural network models. We dive into the details of net inputs, activation functions,
                weights, biases, loss gradients, etc., and how the implementations vary between different model types.
                We hand code each of these models, step by step, tuning hyperparameters and ultimately, training our
                models with real world datasets.</p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">Internships:</h2>
            <p class="section-p">Hopedale IT Department - Over the Summer of 2024, I worked as an IT intern at Hopedale
                Public Schools in Massachusetts. It is a very small school district, so the IT department handles a
                wide variety of things across the schools, and this gave me the chance to gain experience in a lot of
                different areas. I helped with device auditing, inspections, repairing computer internals, device
                imaging, servers and network switches, dropping new ethernet lines, security systems, etc.</p>
            <p class="section-p">NETSCOUT - This past Summer, I worked as a research and development intern at the
                NETSCOUT headquarters in Westford, MA. As a cybersecurity company, privacy is kind of paramount to their
                business, so I genuinely don't know what I am allowed to share about my work there. What I can say
                though, is I learned a lot about network monitoring and the devices used to capture packet data. </p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">My older work:</h2>
            <p class="section-p">I have been shooting professionally for over a decade now, and I was passionate about
                photography long before that. Here are a few random examples of the work I was making in middle school
                and early high school</p>

            <h2 class="section-h2">My current work:</h2>
            <p class="section-p"> In Fall of 2024, I began a photographic project along Route 201 in Maine. The 201
                travels from the Canadian border in the North, down to Brunswick in the South, and passes through
                Waterville on the way. This project has become the focus of what will be my Senior exhibit at the end of
                this year. I don't want to spoil anything, but here are some rough edits from a roll of film I shot in
                last Spring. </p>
